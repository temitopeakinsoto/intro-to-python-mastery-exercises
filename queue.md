A queue is a data structure whose insertion and deletion operation (better known as Enqueuing and Dequeuing)
are done from the FRONT and REAR ends of the list.
 The enqueue and dequeue operations follow the FIFO Rule. I.e First In First Out.

enQueue(5) This operation adds a new node after rear and moves rear to the next node.
e.g enQueue(5) adds 5 to the queue from the rear end of the list

Dequeue() This operation removes the front node and moves front to the next node.
